        <p class="desc">
          Hi! I’m Jonny Shen, finishing up my bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering at UC Davis.
          I originally started in Computer Science and Engineering, but I didn’t find much enjoyment in coding by itself.
          Since I’ve always loved working hands‑on with PC parts and building things, switching to EE made the most sense for me.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          I was born in Los Angeles and moved to North Carolina as a kid, growing up in a small neighborhood in Chapel Hill.
          I really wanted to broaden my horizons and try something new, so I set my sights on schools like UC Davis, and here I am!

        <h2 class="title">Music</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Music is my reset button. I grew up on piano, learned trombone in middle and high school band, and more recently picked up guitar.
          I also love to sing. It’s my favorite way to unplug and make something creative outside of engineering.

        <p class="desc">
          Outside of music, I also like to play raquet sports such as tennis and badminton. I enjoy the fast pace and strategy behind each match, but I also just like the feeling of moving around and having fun while staying competitive.

        <p class="desc">
          I’ve been hands‑on with RF/microwave test gear — running measurements like S‑parameters and return/insertion loss,
          and assembling/validating subsystems. Seeing theory meet the bench taught me calm troubleshooting and clear documentation.
